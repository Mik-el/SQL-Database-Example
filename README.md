# SQL Database Example
## Disclaimer
1) The code I'm sharing contains comments and variable names in italian. (but maybe you'll result to understand since the code is quite easy) 
2) The codes could have errors. If you find them you can use Github to fix it. Thank you!

## What is SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language ) is a programming langauge to manage data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS).
You can use different IDEs, I suggest you to use MySQL Workbench.

## What you can find in this Repo
1) a **.sql file** with a code to make a simple database for a municipal library (you can customize it to your needs) + some queries.
2) a **.pdf file** that will show the right order to use when generating the database table (the order is important for foreign keys) and the outputs generated by the queries
